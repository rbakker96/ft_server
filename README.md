# ft_server 
***This is a System Administration subject. This project is designed to discover Docker and set up my first web server.***

---

### Project summary
> 3th ring Codam project

This project intended to get introduced to system administration. Learning points are to get aware of the importance of using scripts to automate tasks. In this case, the "docker" technology is used. During this project, a complete web server is the end goal. This server will run multiples services: Wordpress, phpMyAdmin, and a SQL-database.

---

### Technical considerations
> The project needs to comply with the following rules/functionalities.

- You must set up a web server with Nginx, in only one docker container. The container OS must be debian buster.
- Your web server must be able to run several services at the same time. The services will be a WordPress website, phpMyAdmin and MySQL. You will need to make sure your SQL database works with the WordPress and phpMyAdmin.
- Your server should be able to use the SSL protocol.
- You will have to make sure that, depending on the url, your server redirects to the correct website.
- You will also need to make sure your server is running with an autoindex that must be able to be disabled.

### Usage
> Run the following commands in the terminal

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/rbakker96/ft_server.git ft_server

$ docker build -t ft_server .
